# Xboing

XBoing is a blockout type game where you have a paddle which you use to
bounce a ball around the game area blowing up blocks with the ball. You win by
obtaining points for each block destroyed and each level completed. The person
with the highest score wins.

## Building Xboing
Build files and project configurations can be generated with [Premake 5](https://premake.github.io).

> Premake is a command line utility which reads a scripted definition of a software project and, most commonly, uses it to generate project files for toolsets like Visual Studio, Xcode, or GNU Make.

See documentation for generating projects:
  - [Windows](docs/building/windows.md)
  - [Linux](docs/building/linux.md)
  - [Macos](docs/building/macosx.md)
